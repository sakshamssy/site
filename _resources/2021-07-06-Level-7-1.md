## What is ROS ?

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source.

The following video will give you a better understanding of what exactly ROS is

## Why ROS ?
(It's the fastest way to build a robot!)

### Global Community

ROS has produced a vast ecosystem of software for robotics by nurturing a global community of millions of developers and users who contribute to and improve that software.

### Proven in use

ROS is relied upon throughout the robotics industry moreover itâ€™s inside robots that are running in production all around the world today. In the autonomous mobile robot (AMR) alone, ROS has helped to create billions of dollars in value.

### Multi domain and Multi Platform

ROS is ready for use across a wide array of robotics applications, from indoor to outdoor, home to automotive, underwater to space, and consumer to industrial.

Moreover ROS is 100 % open source which ensures that the global community has free and unfettered access to a high-quality, best-in-class, fully featured robotics Software devlopment Kit

## Learning ROS

For learing ROS you will be mainly referring to the [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) and the book [Programmming Robots with ROS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hX2J9j_bho7On9zMTCEox6YFtyOVmw39/view).

The course for learning ROS is divided into 7 sections as follows:

## ROS Section 1 - Nodes

### An Overview

ROS basically has the ability of connecting nodes together ,here nodes are like pieces of software which can be written in C or python, nodes can take care of a small subset of tasks like reading a sensor, controlling a servo ect.
The nodes connect together thanks to the publisher, subscriber protocol.
What this means is that if a node has an information to share it will share this information using a topic and if another node is intrested in that information it subscribes to that topic and reads that information.

This section will help to set up a ROS environment and give you a better understanding of nodes.

Resources:

* Tuts 1,2,3,4 and 5 from [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).
* Chapter 1 and 2 from the book.

Also check out the following [git repository.](https://textzip.github.io/posts/ROS-Baiscs/)

### Assignment 1

In a terminal start the **turtlesim_node** with node name as "**my\_node\_1**" in the namespace "**name**". In a seperate terminal start the **turtle\_teleop\_key** with node name as "**my\_node\_2**" without any namespaces, and remap the topic such that it can send telemetry data to the **turtlesim_node** and move the turtle around.

**Kill all previous nodes before starting this question**

### Assignment 2

The figure below shows two broken maps. Complete the graph as per the instructions given below.

![938ce97287f3877b3f33002739ea14e6.png](../_resources/2bf793cdb5b34e918435295863804f19.png)

### Instructions -

1.  The graph should contain 4 **turtlesim_node** nodes -
    Node 1 - ***/input1/turtlesim***
    Node 2 - ***/input2/turtlesim***
    Node 3 - ***/output1/turtlesim***
    Node 4 - ***/output2/turtlesim***
    
2.  Create a node that mimics the action of Node 1 ***/input1/turtlesim*** and instructs Node 4 ***/output2/turtlesim*** to move along the same path. Similarly, create another node that mimics the action of Node2 ***/input2/turtlesim*** and instructs Node 3 ***/output1/turtlesim*** to move along the same path.
    
3.  Use the **turtlesim draw_square** node to instruct Node 1 ***/input1/turtlesim*** to move along a square.
    
4.  Use 2 **turtlesim\_teleop\_key** nodes to control ***/input2/turtlesim*** and ***/output1/turtlesim*** through the keyboard.
    

Goal - The turtles in nodes 1 and 4 should move in a square. The turtles in nodes 2 and 3 should be controlled through the keyboard. When ***/input2/turtlesim*** is controlled using the keyboard, ***/output1/turtlesim*** should mimic the same action.

**Kill all previous nodes before starting this question**

> NOTE - Do not create any launch file for this question. All nodes have to be created from the terminal directly.


## ROS Section 2 - Topics

This section starts with an introduction to how nodes communicate through topics.
Then you will also learn the method to create messages. 

Basically nodes communicate through topics and in order to communicate(send information) they use messages.

This section also teaches you how to create a publisher and subscriber.

A ROS Node can be a Publisher or a Subscriber. A Publisher is the one puts the messages of some standard Message Type to a particular Topic. The Subscriber on the other hand subscribes to the Topic so that it receives the messages whenever any message is published to the Topic.

Resources:

* Tuts 6,8,9,10(10.1,10.2,10.3),12,13 from [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).
*  Chapter 3 from the book.

Also go through the following [git repository.](https://textzip.github.io/posts/ROS-Baiscs/)

### Assignment 1

In a new terminal start the **turtlesim_node** with node name "**turtles**" without any namespaces. In a seperate terminal copy paste the following command

```
rosservice call /spawn "x: 0.0
y: 0.0
theta: 0.0
name: 'turt'"
```

*(Do not worry if you do not understand the command it will be covered in the later sections)* If everything went fine you should see a new turtle in your **turtlesim_node**. Now, figure out a way to use **turtle\_teleop\_key** to control the 2nd turtle.

**Kill all previous nodes before starting this question, also run the following command before starting this exercise to start the turtlebot3 in gazebo:**

`roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch`


### Assignment 2

Create a new package called **session_one** with **rospy** as a dependency, create a new python script called "**move_square.py**" which when executed will listen to a topic called "**/your\_word\_is\_your\_wand**" which has a message type of "**std_msgs/Int32**" once it recieves data from the above mentioned topic, it should direct the turtlebot3 to perform a square with side length being propotional to the integer recieved from the above mentioned topic.

**Kill all previous nodes before starting this question, also run the following command before starting this exercise to start the turtlebot3 in gazebo:**

`roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch`



### Assignment 3

In the previously created package, create a custom message named "**JangoFett.msg**" it should have the following structure:

```
Int32 side
String shape
```

Now, create a new python script called "**move_upgraded.py**" it should listen to the topic called "**/darkside**" which is based on the custom message you created "**JangoFett.msg**", if the shape contains "**circle**" the turtlebot3 should move in a circle where the peremter is propotional to the integer entered in the "**side**", if the shape "**square**", the turtlebot3 should move in a square where the side length is propotional to the integer entered in the "**side**".

**NOTE: The square and circle shapes need not be perfect**

**Kill all previous nodes before starting this question, also run the following command before starting this exercise to start the turtlebot3 in gazebo:**

`roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch`


### Assignment 4

In the previously ceated package, create a new python script called **mole.py** that randomly sends the string "ARC Rocks!" to one of five topics and an empty message to the remaining topics -

1.  **/topic1**
2.  **/topic2**
3.  **/topic3**
4.  **/topic4**
5.  **/topic5**

Create a python script called **subscriber.py** that listens to each of the above topics and asks the user to guess the name of the topic through which the string is being sent. If the user guesses it correctly, he wins.

**Kill all previous nodes before starting this question**

### Assignment 5

#### Introduction to Services:

Make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with 3 nodes - 2 of them should be identical and should represent 2 players of the game, while the third one should be the AI handling the board. The AI should publish the board to the players.

## ROS  Section 3 - Services

This section deals with the synchronous way of communication between the nodes that is through Services.

Services is like a response ,request type communication . You have to send the message (request) and also receive a message (response).
Its a client-server system.

Request / reply is done via a Service, which is defined by a pair of messages: one for the request and one for the reply. A providing ROS node offers a service under a string name, and a client calls the service by sending the request message and awaiting the reply.

An analogy would be Customer and Waiter at a Resteraunt.

Here are the resources:

* Tuts 7,10(10.4,10.5,10.6,10.7),15,16 from [ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).
* Chapter 4 from the book.

Also go through the [git repository.](https://textzip.github.io/posts/ROS-Baiscs/)

### Assignment 1

In the package called **session_one** created previously, create a service server called "/Arda" which can be called using an Empty message. Once called the service server has to send back a list which contains the index of the highest and lowest laser scan readings(in that order) from the turtlebot3.

### Assignment 2

Create a package "custom\_service\_assignment"
Launch the turtlebot3_house.launch launch file
Optional: Create a launch file "custom\_service\_launch.launch" to start the server and client

Write a custom server:
request: distance variable: to move the turtlebot for the specified distance in Gazebo.
response: success flag ( to inform if the required distance was travelled by the bot)
additional_message ( to give any additional information. eg: if the bot failed to cover the distance due to an obstacle)

Your code needs to check for obstacles directly in front of the bot and stop the bot before it hits an obstacle. If the bot is stoppped, then the successs flag should be flase and an appropriate additional_message should be sent.
(Hint: for calculating the distance use the /odom topic)


### Assignment 3

Make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with 3 nodes - 2 of them should be identical and should represent 2 players of the game, while the third one should be the AI handling the board. The AI should publish the board to the players.

### Assignment 4

#### Introduction to Actions:

Launch **turtlebot3** on **gazebo** and give the bot a particular distance to move to. Write a python script that will provide the **status** of the bot and also a **feedback** whenever called. After the robot reaches its target location, it should return the **result** "Destination reached!". You should also be able to **cancel** or stop the bot's motion at any point.

## ROS  Section 4 - Actions

This section consists of ROS Actions which are like synchronous calls to services.

ROS Actions have a client-to-server communication relationship as well with a specified protocol. The actions use ROS topics to send goal messages from a client to the server. You can cancel goals using the action client. After receiving a goal, the server processes it and can give information back to the client. This information includes the status of the server, the state of the current goal, feedback on that goal during operation, and finally a result message when the goal is complete.
